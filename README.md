**Gas System:**

Create gas zones by zeus modules or by fireing mortar rounds.
Entering the gas without a gas mask will give you one of the new injuries and over time will kill you.

Gas masks have a durability that decreases over time. But that can be resetet by using a new gas mask filter.
Unconscious people without a gas mask can be giving them one and putting it on for them to protect them from the gas.

If you get exposed to the gas for to long without a gas mask you get a new injury that can be treated with an antidote.
